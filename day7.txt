SEMATIC HTML PART 2:

***MAIN:
The element <main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage.
contain the principal content.
By using <main> as opposed to a <div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

ex:
<main>
  <header>
    <h1>Types of Sports</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h3>Baseball</h3>

artical and header tag
__________________________________________

**footer

The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the <footer> element. The footer contains information such as:

Contact information
Copyright information
Terms of use
Site Map
Reference to top of page links
For example:

<footer>

***SECTION:
<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.

A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.


<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2> 
</section>
__________________________________________
***ARTICLE
The <article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. <article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An <article> tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.

<article>
    <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>

***The Aside Element
The <aside> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content.
**note:remeber

__________________________________________
***Figure and Figcaption
<figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.

<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg">
  <figcaption>picture</figcaption>
</figure>


<figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the <figure> tag. Usually, <figcaption> will go inside <figure>. This is different than using a <p> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of <figure>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a <figcaption> will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.
__________________________________________
Audio and Attributes:
The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like <video>, <audio> uses src to link the audio source.

**attributes:
src,type="audio/mp.3,loop,muted(false by default if we dont add)
<controls>---inside audio to add neccesary controls---same as vedio
_____________________________________________
Video and Embed:
 The <video> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.

Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:

controls: When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a fullscreen option.
autoplay: The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.
loop: This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.
ex----<video src="coding.mp4" controls>Video not supported</video>

<embed> tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source
The <embed> tag is a self-closing tag

<embed src="download.gif"/>
