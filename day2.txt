Line Breaks


The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn’t affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML’s line break element: <br>.

Unordered Lists

In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The <ul> element should not hold raw text and won’t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.


Ordered Lists


Ordered lists (<ol>) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.


Images

The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the <img> tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will render properly.

The <img> tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set to the image’s source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored.

Image Alts

The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites. The alt attribute can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute. The value of alt should be a description of the image.


The alt attribute also serves the following purposes:

If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made possible by the description you provide in the alt attribute.
Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image’s description out loud to the visually impaired user.
The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot “see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.


Videos
In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> element, the <video> element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <img> element however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.

<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>

In this example, the video source (src) is "myVideo.mp4". The source can be a video file that is hosted alongside your webpage, or a URL that points to a video file hosted on another webpage.

After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.

The text, Video not supported, between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.


------------------------------------------
Preparing for HTML:

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

 It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document.



The <html> Tag:

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>


The Head:

The <head> element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above our <body> element.

The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself.


Page Titles:

A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.

Linking to Other Web Pages:

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.

<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
Opening Links in a New Window:using target=_blank in anchor


Linking to Relative Page

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>


Linking At Will:

when you click on a photo then we reach to next website
 using img tag instead of text in btwn anchor tag



Linking to Same Page:


In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:

<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link.


***White spaces and Indentation***
to increase readability of code and decrese complexity


***Comments***
<!-- comment you want to write -->
Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:

They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.
They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.
