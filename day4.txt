***DROPDOWN LIST***
List of options in which user can select one.
choose one option from an organized list. Hereâ€™s the code to create a dropdown menu


The text rendered is the text included between the opening and closing <option> tags. However, it is the value of the value attribute that is used in <form> submission (notice the difference in the text and value capitalization). When the <form> is submitted, the information from this input field will be sent using the name of the <select> and the value of the chosen <option>. For instance, if a user selected Pizza from the dropdown list, the information would be sent as "lunch=pizza".
