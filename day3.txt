***Table***
table tag to display the content in tabular form
 it contains the rows, columns, and cells that will hold data. In HTML, all of these components must be created.
The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: <tr>.
Rows aren’t sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: <td>.

Table Headings
Table data doesn’t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.

<th scope="col">Sunday</th>

Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:

row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.

**border=1 is an attribute in table tag to specify the border but in present versions we are using css to create borders

***spanning columns

colspan attribute inside table data with the value

syntax<tb colspan="value">

**spanning rows:
rowspan att---td --values
------------------------------------------table body :
inside table tag
the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.

table head:
all the heading rows of the table must be kept in the <thead> tag

table footer:
at the end of the table to add sums etc
suntax
<tfoot><td> we dont use <tr> in these
------------------------------------------

FORM:

There’s a good chance that if you’re typing into a text field or providing an input, the field that you’re typing into is part of a <form>!

form action="/example.html" method="POST">
</form>
The action attribute determines where the information is sent.

The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.

the method name can is not case sensitive
 ***form can have child elements like para,heading etc to provide user more info

**INPUT:
to enter input form user side
we will use<input> tag
att:type(by default text),name(name to send the information after the form is submitted)

<input type="text" name="first-text-field">
***NO CLOSING TAG FOR INPUT***

value attribute 
the value is assigned to the name attribute when the form is submitted
**we can also provide pre defined text for value**

****placeholder-- to place the text in grey colour*****

lable
have opening and closing tag
We then assign the for attribute of the <label> element with the value of the id attribute of <input>
